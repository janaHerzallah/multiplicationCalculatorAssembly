# Calculator Using PIC16F877A (EMBEDDED SYSTEMS).

Supervised by Prof. Hanna Bullata.
This project aims to create a straightforward calculator capable of performing multiplication of two-digit numbers using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. The setup involves a push button for inputting numbers and a 16x2 LCD for displaying prompts and results, all managed by the master microcontroller. The process is user-friendly, starting with a welcome message, followed by step-by-step instructions for entering numbers, and culminating in the display of the multiplication result. An auxiliary microcontroller assists in the calculations to ensure accuracy. The design and communication protocols are mapped out in Proteus, with programming done in MPLAB IDE using PIC assembly language, focusing on a simple yet effective user experience. This project combines hardware and software engineering to create a functional calculator designed for ease of use and reliability.
